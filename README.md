# odin-landing-page

The purpose of this project is to practice using CSS flexbox to create a basic landing page.

Skills:
    - use gitHUB and git commands to document progress
    - use HTML to place content
    - use CSS flexbox layout to style content

Lessons learned:
    -"git commit -a" does not stage newly made files which is why half the history for styles.css is missing. Use "git add -A && git commit -m ' '" to stage and commit all and new files.
    -certain flex properties only work when applied to flex containers or flex items.
