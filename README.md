# Landing page
[Live Demo](https://leeyuh8.github.io/landing-page/)

## Purpose:
To practice using CSS flexbox to create a basic landing page template.

## Skills:
- use gitHub and git commands to document progress
- use HTML to place content
- use CSS flexbox to style content

## Lessons learned:
- "git commit -a" does not stage newly made files which is why half the history for styles.css is missing. Use "git add -A && git commit -m ' '" to stage and commit all and new files.
- certain flex properties only work when applied to flex containers or flex items.
